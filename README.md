# 🦴 MICROSCAN: A Smart Sensing System for Bone Crack Detection Using Microwaves


## 🎉 Project Milestone

**Thrilled to announce the successful completion of our model _MICROSCAN_** – a **portable smart sensing device** designed to detect bone cracks using microwave technology.

---

## 🧠 What is MICROSCAN?

**MICROSCAN** is a compact and intelligent bone crack detection system that combines **hardware (microstrip patch antennas)** and **software (for data analysis and visualization)**.

### 🔍 Key Features:
- ✅ Non-invasive and painless detection
- ✅ Real-time S11 parameter analysis
- ✅ Portability for field and clinic use
- ✅ Adaptability to different bone sizes

---

## 💡 Why Is It Needed?

Current technologies like **X-rays and MRIs** suffer from:
- ❌ High cost
- ❌ Bulky machinery
- ❌ Long diagnostic times
- ❌ Manual interpretation

**MICROSCAN** offers:
- 💰 Cost-effectiveness
- 🧳 Portability
- ⚡ Fast, semi-automated analysis
- 👨‍⚕️ Reduced need for human intervention

---

## 🧪 Scientific Principle

We use **microstrip patch antennas**, known for:
- Compact size and ease of fabrication
- Operation at microwave frequencies (2.4 GHz)
- Efficient penetration into biological tissue

These properties make them ideal for low-cost, reliable, and scalable medical diagnostic tools.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Antennas emit low-frequency microwaves (2.4 GHz)** onto the bone.
2. **Microwave interaction with bone tissue** is measured using **S11 parameters**.
3. Based on changes in **dielectric properties**, the system detects the presence of cracks.
4. The software **analyzes and visualizes** these results in real-time.
